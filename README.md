QUICK START
=====

1. Install HASP as usual but use the [HASwitchplate_2.4.tft](https://github.com/zonko16/Custom-Pages-for-HASwitchplate/blob/master/Nextion%20HMI/HASwitchPlate_2.4.tft) provided by this repository instead. 

2. Replace the yaml files in ```config/packages/plate01``` with the ones provided in this repository.
    - For the **2.4" Panel** use .yamls in [packages_2.4in/](https://github.com/zonko16/Custom-Pages-for-HASwitchplate/tree/master/packages_2.4in) 
    - For the **3.2" Panel** use .yamls in [packages_3.2in/](https://github.com/zonko16/Custom-Pages-for-HASwitchplate/tree/master/packages_3.2in)

  **Update 0.3:** You can access a Menu with extra pages using the new **alternative Theme**.
  Coming from previous release add/replace ```hasp_plate01_p0_pages.yaml```, ```hasp_plate01_p1_menu.yaml```, ```hasp_palte01_p2_scripts.yaml```, ```hasp_plate01_p4_sliders.yaml```, ```hasp_plate01_p7_playlist.yamlÂ´``
  It's recommended to deactivate any colorconfig.yaml as colors are already set in the firmware.

3. Replace YOUR_API_KEY in ```hasp_plate01_00_components.yaml``` with your own Darksky API 

4. Replace the entities and names to your liking for every page in the different YAML files.
Entities that need to be changed are called like **switch.YOUR_ENTITY**, **senor.YOUR_TEMPERATURE** and so on.
**IMPORTANT UPDATE:** This step hast been considerably simplified for page 6. 
- Open ```hasp_plate01_p6_entities.yaml```
- In there you'll find 
```
hasp_plate01_p6_toggle1-12(16):
  name: Toggle 1-12(16)
  entities:
  - switch.DUMMY
```
- replace **switch.DUMMY** with the component you are using for ever single button and set the name for your toggle.

5. (3.2" users skip this step) If you're using a **second temperature/humidity** and want to switch between In and  Out by clicking on the displayed temperature uncomment lines 280 to 288 in ```hasp_plate01_p0_pages.yaml```:

```

**_Page 3 Weather Setup_**

You'll need a [Darksky API](https://darksky.net/dev) to use the weather component. Place your API key into ```hasp_plate01_p3_weather.yaml```. 

Special thanks to **@aderusha** for creating HASwitchPlate and **@madrian** for spending hours of beta testing with me.
