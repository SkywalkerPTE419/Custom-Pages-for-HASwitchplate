The enhanced version of the Nextion panels isn't supported by now. 
If you have a enhanced Version you will have to compile the provided "HASwitchPlate.hmi" in the Nextion Editor yourself.

For now you can choose between the 2.4" and 3.2" panel. 
The .hmi is also included for both so you can edit it too.
